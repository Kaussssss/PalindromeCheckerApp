# PalindromeCheckerApp
A Step class Repo for learning and enhancing skills in java


✅ PalindromeCheckerApp

📌 Objective

The objective of the Palindrome Checker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that checks whether a given string is a palindrome using different data structure approaches.

This project helps to understand:

Stack (LIFO)

Queue (FIFO)

Logical comparison of characters

Basic Git workflow

✅ Use Case 6 – Queue + Stack Based Palindrome Check
🎯 Goal

To demonstrate the difference between:

Queue (FIFO – First In First Out)

Stack (LIFO – Last In First Out)

And use them together to validate whether a string is a palindrome.

🔄 Flow of Execution

User enters a string.

Each character is:

Enqueued into a Queue.

Pushed into a Stack.

Characters are removed:

From Queue using Dequeue (FIFO).

From Stack using Pop (LIFO).

Compare both characters.

If all characters match → It is a Palindrome.

If mismatch occurs → Not a Palindrome.
